# Overview

A little while ago, I had an intership interview. I felt prepared for the interview, except for 1 thing - the main language used by the company was C#, and my C# was very rusty.

To prepare, I read the entirety of Learning C# In A Day. Then, I decided to solve seven of the most common LeetCode problems to learn the language in a challenging situation.

These programs are intended simply as demonstrations or tutorials on how to solve these problems.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I exclusively used Visual Studio to write my code. It's a fantastic IDE.

I did not use any libraries except for LINQ. If you see a different libary in my code, that's because Visual Studio decided I needed it for some reason.

# Useful Websites

I did not use a lot of websites for this project because my goal was to learn the language in a trial by fire. However, I did read several books.

# Future Work

I would like to add the entirety of the Blind 75 LeetCode problems here in the future. For now, we just have the easiest and most common ones.
